%% NOTES ON THE PROCESS TO NORMALIZE RMS FOR STIMULI
The end goal of normalization was to ensure that each stimuli is equally as loud. 
Importantly, the scripts that added the multitalker babble noise mix the two tracks
in a way that preserves the original gain of the signal (i.e. sentences) and titrates
the babble to the correct intensity to create a given SNR ratio. To preserve this
gain, I first equalized the RMS of the sentences without babble. Then, I added the 
multitalker babble. Lastly, I adjusted the RMS of the primes and practice sentences
to match the RMS of these new multitalker sentences.
