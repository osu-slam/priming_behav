For each sentence, you need to identify the\n*gender* of the person performing the action.

If the gender of the person performing the\naction is male, press the right arrow key.\n\nIf the gender of the person performing the\naction is female, press the left arrow key.
Let's do a practice block. You will hear a constant\nmetronome and then the 8 sentences will begin.\n\nDuring the practice, the "male" and "female"\nlabels will flash green if you are correct, or\nred if you are wrong.\n\nYou will have 5 seconds to respond each trial.
Great job! You answered %s out of 8 sentences\ncorrectly.\n\nExperimenter: press the left arrow\nkey to repeat the practice block.
Now let's move onto the real experiment. You\nwill not be told if you are right or wrong\nafter each sentence.\n\nGood luck!
